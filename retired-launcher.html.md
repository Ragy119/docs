We've retired our web-based launchers for individual apps like Jupyter and code-server. If the app you'd like to launch has an official Docker image, it's pretty easy to launch it yourself. Here are a couple of places to start:


[Speedrun: Launch on Fly.io](/docs/speedrun/)

[Deploy via Dockerfile](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/)
